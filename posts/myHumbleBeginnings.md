**Once upon a midnight dreary**
whilst I wondered weak and weary/

across the flightline I did see
an expeditor looking back at me/

he rolled up quick.
said i would do the trick/

he dropped me off across the line.
to another job that would take time/

**i still havent eaten**
I need to pee.
the man wont let me/

why did I reenlist
what did I think I'd really miss/

**software beckons me**
